# UselessDaysTranslator
Attention: don't take this project seriously 
A stupid program created because I have nothing to do, it asks for the lang (it = italian, en = English), uses reflection to create a new istance of the class of the day and then it prints it!
What uses could this have? Well obviously none at all
